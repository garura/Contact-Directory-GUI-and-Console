# Contact-Directory-GUI-and-Console
Demo of GUI: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkQYEbxt26rIpp-Nc7GsGvuhFUs8hTXy3U3XGiyokNs/edit

This contact directory was for a class project. The assignment was meant to be console based, but was allowed to be done with a GUI (we didn't know anything about GUIs yet!). We went for it, and in the process got our first taste of an MVC design. Not perfect, but we were pretty proud of how it turned out!
